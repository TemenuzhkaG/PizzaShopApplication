# PizzaShopApplication
My first complete MVC application developed as a course project for the university. It is a basic system for ordering pizzas. Consumers can browse and buy pizzas. They can also write comments about pizzas.
A shopping cart has also been implemented, in which the ordered products can be seen, as well as their quantity.
