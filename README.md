# PizzaShopApplication
   ASP.NET Project
     My first complete MVC application, developed as a course project for the university. MS SQL Server was used to store the data, as well as the code first approach. The project is a basic system for ordering pizzas. Consumers can browse and buy pizzas. They can also write comments about pizzas.A shopping cart has also been implemented, in which the ordered products can be seen, as well as their quantity.

   For testing application, please use info for database.txt file :)
